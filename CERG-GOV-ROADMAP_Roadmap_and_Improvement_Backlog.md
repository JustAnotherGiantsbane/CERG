# CERG Living Roadmap

**Created:** 2026-06-11
**Source:** Comprehensive external review — 170+ suggestions across adoption, architecture, evidence, compliance, engineering, and community
**Purpose:** Track all improvement opportunities. Items are not commitments — they are prioritized suggestions for maintainers and contributors.

---

## Priority Model

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **P0** | Contradictions, broken references, unsafe defaults, regulatory overclaims — fix immediately |
| **P1** | Adoption blockers, missing examples, missing small-team guidance, missing evidence guidance |
| **P2** | Nice-to-have: diagrams, additional overlays, tooling integrations, filled templates |
| **P3** | Long-term: community growth, release management, external review board |
